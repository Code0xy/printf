Printf
The printf project is a collaboration project by Linda Matunga and Biruke Lemma, students of the ALX Software Engineering Programme.
printf (print formatted) in C, writes out a cstring to stdout (standard output). The provided cstring may contain format specifiers( beginning with % in the cstring).
